for setup guide for deploying keystone app to heroku

Make sure mongo is installed
Start mongo with `mongod`
You may need to change permissions on /data/db for mongo to run.

 Try sudo chown $USER /data/db
 To find the user `whoami`


Set env vars in the production environment, for example in heroku control panel.
.env file keystone creates (yeoman geneerator) is gitignored
Copy the vars set there into production server

Then, check the environment keystone is running in.
E.g. set mongo to the mongodb_uri key in prod otherwise set to localhost (should this be the /data/db?? - check)

// Set the database
keystone.set('mongo', process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/learnings');

// Check the environment keystone is running in.  If the production flag is set (on production server),
set the cloudinary config and the cookie secret.  Should mongo_db be set here?
If it's production

if (keystone.get('env') == 'production'){
	console.info('env = ' + keystone.get('env'));
    keystone.set('cloudinary config', process.env.CLOUDINARY_URL);
    keystone.set('cookie secret', process.env.COOKIE_SECRET);
}

To find the mongodb's that you have installed locally
mongo  --eval  "printjson(db.adminCommand('listDatabases'))" 
You can run commands from within the mongo shell, which can be started with `mongo`
Tell it which database to use (not sure if this is setting stuff of just for purpose of mongo shell exploration)
`use learnings`
`show collections` (should see something like app_updates, users)
`db.<collection>.find()` lists objects in collection

note `help` can be used to list commands available
